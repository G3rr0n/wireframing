# wireframing
A wireframe is a simple visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website or digital product. Think of it as the blueprint for your final design. You’re providing enough detail so that everyone knows the shape of the wall, but you’re not getting so deep into it that you’re giving exact details on the type of brick the walls should be made of (that comes later). Though wireframes are most often created by designers, they need to be basic enough so that everyone from other designers, stakeholders, devs, and users can understand the ideas.
