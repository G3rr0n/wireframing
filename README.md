# wireframing
A wireframe is a simple visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website or digital product. Think of it as the blueprint for your final design. You’re providing enough detail so that everyone knows the shape of the wall, but you’re not getting so deep into it that you’re giving exact details on the type of brick the walls should be made of (that comes later). Though wireframes are most often created by designers, they need to be basic enough so that everyone from other designers, stakeholders, devs, and users can understand the ideas.

### Layout Structure
The layout structure is the basic framework of a wireframe that shows how elements are arranged on a page. It defines the overall look and flow of the interface using grids and spacing. For example, in a booking platform, the property listings could be displayed in a grid in the center with filters on the left and navigation at the top. This helps users quickly locate what they need and keeps the design organized and consistent.


### Navigation
Navigation refers to the menus, links, and buttons that help users move between different pages or sections of a website or app. It’s an important part of usability because it helps users know where they are and how to get to where they want to go. For instance, a simple top navigation bar with links like “Home,” “Browse Listings,” and “Profile” makes it easy for users to find their way around.


### Content Placement
Content placement focuses on where text, images, and other elements appear on the screen. Placing information in the right order helps guide users’ attention and makes the design easier to understand. For example, on a property details page, you might place the property name and price at the top, followed by images, descriptions, and a “Book Now” button. This logical flow ensures users see important details first.


### Functionality
Functionality in a wireframe represents how users will interact with the design. It includes elements like buttons, forms, search bars, or filters that allow users to perform actions. For example, having a search bar with filters for price and location in a property listing page makes the site more interactive and useful, helping users achieve their goals efficiently.


### Types of Wireframes
Low fidelity is the most basic type of wireframing. It’s so simplistic, that paper and pen will still suffice as a way to represent your ideas, however, creating your wireframes in Figma will allow you to easily share them and make sure your team has access to your latest thinking as you iterate. Low fidelity wireframes are done in grayscale with a focus on layout and high-level interactions. UI elements and content are represented by basic shapes like squares, triangles, circles, and lines.


High fidelity wireframing takes what you put together in the low fidelity stage and sprinkles in more of the detailed elements. High fidelity wireframes include visual markers and branding signifiers like colors, graphics, and font style. UI elements look realistic and might even include textures and shadows. At this stage, a designer might also choose to add in images and copy. This wireframing kit will get you started with all the basics you need to create great looking high fidelity wireframes.

### Popular wireframing tools
There’s almost no wrong time to use a wireframe, but there are some instances when they can be extra helpful. Whether you’re trying to explain your idea to someone, get all the stakeholders on the same page, force a group decision, or validate your plan, a wireframe presents a simple visual representation that everyone can point to.

Some designers like to continue sketching wireframes by hand using a blank sheet of computer paper, or dot grid journals. For those that want to jump into designing on-screen, Figma has a wireframe template to get you started. Figma is browser-based, so sharing your wireframes is as easy as sharing a link. Your team can leave comments right on the file so you can easily get feedback and field questions.
